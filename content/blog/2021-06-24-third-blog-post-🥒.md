**Accessing the CMS**Â Once you've reached this point, you should be able to access the CMS in your browser atÂ `http://localhost:3000/admin`. You'll be prompted to add the URL of your Netlify site. Once you've added that URL, you can log in with an Identity account or with one of the External Providers you enabled in step 3 above. For the sake of this tutorial, you can create a blog post in the CMS, and publish it! Once youÂ `git pull`Â in your project, the blog post will show up in the project atÂ `content/blog/<slugified-blog-post-title>.md`.
